# Do you want to post bugs? #

If the answer to that question is "No, I just want to see the bugs in the rom" then you can skip below to "Continue"
Otherwise... keep reading....

# Simple bug-posting rules: #

  * ### Check if there is a similar bug already posted ###
If it isn't then check again.
If it is, input your thoughts in that thread
  * ### Be **VERY** specific. ###
Bugs like... "Wifi doesn't work. (end of bug report)" are not useful for anybody and will be ignored. There is a template when you try to post a bug. Use it, don't delete it and post whatever you want in there...
  * ### Be nice ###
Demanding things, saying "Help pls" and other irrelevant things will get your issue ignored.
  * ### Don't ask for advice ###
This is not a discussion thread... If you want to ask something then use the [XDA Thread](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1833218).

Most of all remember: You are trying to help me help you. So if you are nice to me and respect these rules there should be no problems. But if you don't then my arterial pressure will rise, I'll get all red in the face and my ears will burst off my head. Not to mention your issue will (at the very least) be ignored.

If you think you understood everything then click this big green button. If not, then read again or ask for help in the thread.
